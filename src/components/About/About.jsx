            Hello, friends! My name is Kyrylo Trytiachenko, and I am the owner
            of a construction company. I have been working in the construction
            industry for over 8 years. I started my journey in this profession
            as an assistant to a plaster master, and during this time I acquired
            vast experience and skills that help me complete any project with
            high quality and on time. Construction for me is not only a job, but
            also a real art that requires a lot of knowledge, skills and
            creativity. I am proud to be part of an industry that is constantly
            evolving and bringing new technologies and ways of working. I am
            ready to share my experience and knowledge with you. We are pleased

              I contacted this company and used them for the first time and I
              can not say enough about them! They were amazing! They are hard
              working men! They ask questions prior to make sure itâ€™s what YOU
              want done! They do their very best to keep your house clean by
              laying blankets down where ever they are walking outside of the
              area where the work is being done! Very polite and are very
              professional and hard working! I LOVE my new bathroom and will
              continue to use them for other jobs!! HIGHLY recommended Thank you
              so very much Kyrylo and your guys! You guys are amazing!
